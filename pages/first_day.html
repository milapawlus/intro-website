    <p>On the first day at <a href="https://sundsgarden.se/" target="_blank">Sundsg√•rden Folk High School</a>,
        it was introductory day and I had a chance to meet some amazing people from my class.
        Michelle is the course responsible and she gave us a brief description about the course.
        Mainly we came to know how and what we are going to learn in the course.
        We got introduced to our communication platform - Microsoft Teams.</p>
